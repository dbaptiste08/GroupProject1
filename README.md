# Problem Description:
The task at hand is to create and model a database for a membership based tennis club. In order to use this club, members must purchase a membership and in return get access to the clubâ€™s courts which include indoor and outdoor courts, access to a variety of tournaments, lessons with a tennis coach, and orders.
